boofstream is an overlay tool created by viboof that connects to a Wii running
Melee through a Slippi console relay.  it is capable of switching OBS scenes
when the game starts/ends, automatically updating the set count
and each player's characters, and pulling set and player info from start.gg.

## thanks
- huge thanks to the talented

[slippi-js](https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-js) and
[slp-realtime](https://github.com/vinceau/slp-realtime), without either of

direct support for some

still use
