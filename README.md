boofstream is a simple streaming tool created by viboof originally for use in
the [Munchie Bar Melee Extravaganza](https://start.gg/mbme) (RIP) broadcasts,
and is now in use in various random viboof-produced tournaments.

## layouts
boofstream is (somewhat) compatible with TournamentStreamHelper layouts (tested
on `scoreboard_4by3/melee_cameras` and commentator views).  these layouts are
provided stock with boofstream.

## how to
[boofstream in 4m20s on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEvCFOHxqaw)

1. head to [the releases page](https://github.com/viboof/boofstream/releases)
1. click the latest release
1. download the zip file for your OS/architecture (note: only tested on Windows
x64)
1. unzip the file, keep boofstream in the directory with all its files
1. run boofstream.exe

## why not TSH?
in my experience, TournamentStreamHelper is fairly unstable on macOS, which the
Munchie Bar stream is run on (i'm no Apple fangirl, but find me a better 
graphics power/battery life/build quality/portability mix for a bar stream).  i
love the software though, and take great inspiration from it.  i also intend on
have some cool functionality involving realtime stuff with Slippi console 
mirroring, so it's nice to have total control over and familiarity with the
codebase.

## thanks
- huge thanks to the talented 
[Vince Au](https://github.com/vinceau) for maintaining
[slippi-js](https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-js) and
[slp-realtime](https://github.com/vinceau/slp-realtime), without either of
which this project would've been impossible, as well as providing me with
direct support for some 
[internals weirdness](https://github.com/viboof/boofstream/commit/1b33df4b47f5cf7fea0b5e2aa489ec60f77097ce).
- thank you to DOOB for giving me a chance running the Munchie Bar stream as a newcomer
- gracias to [Jo√£o Ribeiro Bezerra](https://github.com/joaorb64) for creating
[TournamentStreamHelper](https://github.com/joaorb64/TournamentStreamHelper),
which i used extensively prior to developing boofstream, and whose layouts i
still use
- danke to everyone who watches the streams i produce :)
